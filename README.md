# Shadman_Choudhury_F23

This is a Game Engine project meant to exercise our abilities when dealing with Bridge and Singleton design patterns. Additionally, it enforces and reaffirms positive habits when dealing with third party libraries. 
The overall "Game" created on the engine is a basic test of functionality using GLFW/GLAD for display and STBI for asset input. This project uses both static and dynamic libraries, with the Orchid Engine itself being a Dynamic Library to be used. 

Hopeful future Additions:
- Rotation of assets, to prevent size bloating resulting from duplicate assets that are simply rotated versions of each other.
- Sound system for music and sound effects to play while the game runs.
- Exercise the Bridge design pattern by implementing other libraries for various purposes, i.e. iOS devices that are incompatible with GLFW and OpenGL.
